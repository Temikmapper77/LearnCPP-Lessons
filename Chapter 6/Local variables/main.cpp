/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, one named smaller, the other named larger. 
If the user enters a smaller value for the second integer, use a block and a temporary variable to swap the smaller and larger values. 
Then print the values of the smaller and larger variables. 
Add comments to your code indicating where each variable dies. 
Note: When you print the values, smaller should hold the smaller input and larger the larger input, no matter which order they were entered in.
